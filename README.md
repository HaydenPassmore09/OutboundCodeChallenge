Objective

This exercise is designed to allow developers to demonstrate their problem-solving skills with a straight forward coding exercise. It will form the basis for discussion, where the candidate will be expected to answer questions on their design decisions, strengths of their implementation and ideas for further enhancement or improvement.
The candidate should not spend more than two hours on this task. We do not expect to see a polished complete solution.

The Task

Create a web based UI which to allow upload of a CSV file to a C# based backend. The backend should parse the CSV file and store the data in an SQL database (no inline queries).
The UI should then allow for rendering of the data in a tabular format.

Constraints

The backend should be written in C#.
The candidate can use any client side JavaScript framework of their choice.
The CSV parsing code should not make use of any existing libraries – we’re interested to see how the candidate approaches solutions to this.

Guidelines

There is no right or wrong answer to this challenge. We’re looking to gain an insight into the candidate’s approach to developing a solution.
The code should ideally demonstrate the use of some or all of the following:
Well defined objects and interfaces.
Clear separation of concerns.
Application of appropriate patterns.
No code duplication.
Testability.e
Consideration given to performance, scalability and security.
Consideration given to elegant UX and UI design.
Use of commented code where appropriate.
The candidate should be able to clearly articulate any additional work required to complete the challenge.

There is a test file in the folder named "Test" in the root.
